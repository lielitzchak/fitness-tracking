      <p>
        Hey. I'm Liel Itzchak, and I am developing this application. I couldn't
        find an other application that could provide me with what I needed, so I
        created my own. I would really appreciate hearing ideas to make this
        application better. If you would like to know more about this app,
        please send me a message. Have a nice day and thank you very much for
        your attention.
      </p>
